<h1 align = "center">waver_description package</h1>

## Overview

The `waver_description` package provides a 3D model and the corresponding URDF files for the [Wave Rover](https://www.waveshare.com/wave-rover.htm) robot, including an integrated LIDAR sensor model. This package was developed using the [3D model](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/WAVE_ROVER#Robot_Model) provided by Waveshare.

The 3D model was imported into [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360) in order to separate the meshes, and generate the URDF files using [fusion2urdf](https://github.com/syuntoku14/fusion2urdf) tool. Modifications were made to the files generated by URDF_Exporter such as the robot's orientation, robot scale, joints, inertia and others. The robot's link inertia matrix was fixed using [calc-inertia](https://github.com/gstavrinos/calc-inertia?tab=readme-ov-file#calc_inertiapy).

The package includes:
- **Meshes and URDF files:** These files define the physical and kinematic properties of the Wave Rover, enabling accurate representation and simulation of the robot in a virtual environment.
- **LIDAR model:** Model of the [LIDAR sensor](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/DTOF_LIDAR_LD19#3D_Model), fully integrated into the robotâ€™s URDF.

This package is essential for spawning the Wave Rover robot in a simulation environment.
